https://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php/CO2_Sensor_SKU:SEN0159

This arduino Co2 gas sensor has MG-811 sensor module which is highly sensitive to CO2 and less sensitive to alcohol and CO, low humidity & temperature dependency
Onboard heating circuit brings the best temperature for sensor to function. Internal power boosting to 6V for heating sensor best performance
It can be used in air quality control; ferment process control; room temperature Co2 concentration detection
This is an electrochemical CO2 sensor, it is suitable for qualitative analysis
Its detect range is 400 to 10000 ppm
